## Description

The Cashflow Minimiser Splitwise is a solution designed to minimize the overall cash flow among a group of people involved in financial transactions. It utilizes a greedy approach to settle the amounts owed between individuals, reducing the complexity of multiple transactions.

The algorithm begins by selecting a person and settling all their debts with other individuals in the group. It then moves on to the next person, iteratively settling their debts until all outstanding balances are resolved. By doing so, the algorithm aims to minimize the total number of transactions required to achieve a balanced cash flow.

## Skills Nurtured

The implementation of the Splitwise Cashflow Minimization Algorithm requires the utilization of data structures, including:

- **Heap**: A heap data structure is used to efficiently select the person with the maximum outstanding debt in each iteration. This helps in optimizing the settlement process and reducing the overall complexity.
- **Graph**: The algorithm employs a graph-based approach to represent the financial relationships between individuals. The debts between people are represented as edges in the graph, and the algorithm aims to remove unnecessary edges by settling debts.

## Technology Stack

The Splitwise Cashflow Minimization Algorithm has been implemented using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The algorithm's user interface has been developed using HTML, providing the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: CSS stylesheets have been used to enhance the visual presentation of the user interface, making it more appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to implement the algorithm logic and handle user interactions on the web page.
- **PHP**: PHP is used on the server-side to process and handle the algorithm's data and calculations.
